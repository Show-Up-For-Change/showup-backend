Hello, how are you doing today? I'm well. I’m calling today to demand that the (insert title here) respond to the President’s designation of Antifa as a terrorist group. I want to know exactly what measures and legislation the (congressmember, representative, insert title here) will support to not only demilitarize police, but denounce the President’s classification of Antifa as a terrorist organization.
Antifa isn’t an organization and has no leadership or hierarchy. By designating them as a terrorist organization, the President has given law enforcement free reign to treat them as enemy combatants and ignore their constitutional protections. How is your office going to respond to this attack on free speech? What is the (title of person) going to do to protect Americans as they fight in the streets for a better future? I don’t want to hear about your email newsletter or your press statement, I want results. 
The President literally tweeted “when the looting starts the shooting starts” and now his administration is taking steps to ensure that can actually happen without any repercussions. What are you going to do about this? This is absolutely ridiculous and I demand that the (title of person) unequivocally condemn his language and move towards curtailing this crazy abuse of power.
I also want to know whether or not the (title of person) will be supporting the EARN It Act. This bill is a bullshit way to invade the privacy of Americans and further erode freedom of speech. I demand that the (title of person) move to immediately condemn this bill if they are not co-sponsors. If they are co-sponsors, please explain to me why they support the invasion of privacy and the destruction of the first amendment. They need to get a statement out immediately to condemn all of this and to clearly explain what they’re going to do to fight this and how. ",,,,
